# **Next-Gen 3D ChatBot**
![alt text](<Avatar.png>)

An interactive AI chatbot that provides text-to-speech responses synchronized with facial expressions, using advanced 3D avatars generated with **Ready Player Me**. Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Three.js**, and **GROQ API**, the chatbot offers a rich user experience that combines dynamic animations, expressive avatars, and advanced AI capabilities.

## **Features**

### **1. Dynamic 3D Avatars**
- **Avatar Customization**: Avatars are created using **Ready Player Me**, allowing users to generate lifelike 3D avatars from photos or customize them through an interactive UI.
- **GLTF Support**: Easily import and render 3D avatar models (GLTF format) for seamless integration.

### **2. Facial Expressions and Animations**
- Real-time facial animations synchronized with the chatbot’s speech.
- Expressions change dynamically based on context (e.g., happy, surprised, or neutral).

### **3. AI Text-to-Speech**
- **Speech Synchronization**: Uses the browser's SpeechSynthesis API to deliver human-like responses.
- **Typewriter Effect**: Displays text responses word by word, synced with speech output.

### **4. Powered by GROQ API**
- Fetches conversational data and responses efficiently with the GROQ API.
- Ensures fast, scalable, and reliable backend integration.

### **5. Built with Modern Web Technologies**
- **Next.js**: A powerful React-based framework for building server-rendered and static web applications.
- **Three.js**: A versatile library for rendering 3D avatars and animations.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.
